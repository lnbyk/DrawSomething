# DrawSomething
  <pre> 
  &nbsp players take turns drawing a picture to convey the guess word for their partner to guess.
  The person drawing is provided random words, and he/she needs to draw the word out and the
  other player should guess. If they guess correct, they will get the points.</pre>
